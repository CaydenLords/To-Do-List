# Overview

I've used Javascript a lot when programming with HTML, but I've never really used it as a programming language on its own. This program was made to change that. Instead running with Node.js, it's pure Javascript. This practice program was a farily simple To-Do List manager, but it allowed me to get familiar with the recursive functions and asynchronous code that Javascript contains.

# Development Environment

This program was made in Visual Studio Code. Programmed with the language Javascript, it uses Node and Moment as libraries.

# Future Work

In the future, the first thing I'd like to do is add dates to the all of the to-do tasks. While I display the current date with Moment, I had hoped to use Moment to display dates for all the tasks, but I ran out of time. I'd also like to be able to use the asynchronous effects of Javscript better, as they ended up causing me more trouble than anything.
